# Background

This project is an implementation of a national map of waste/recycling infrastructure to depict system capacity. It is inspired by one of the goals laid out in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) [National Recycling Strategy](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2021-11/final-national-recycling-strategy.pdf). 

Our take on this national map is that it could be used as an open, wiki-style map that any stakeholder can access and build upon. 
## EPA 2021 National Recycling Strategy B1.1
Create a national map of existing recycling infrastructure to depict
available recycling system capacity. Building on existing information,
develop a map of recycling infrastructure that includes key elements of the
recycling system, from available collection points (e.g., drop-off centers,
scrap yards, MRFs), sortation and secondary processing facilities (e.g.,
MRFs, baling operations, scrap yards, plastics reclaimers, pulp mills, glass
beneficiation facilities), and, ultimately, manufacturing centers that use the
recycled materials (e.g., plastic/products manufacturers, paper/paperboard
mills, steel/aluminum mills, glass product/packaging manufacturers).
